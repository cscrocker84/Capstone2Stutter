Stutter Like You Mean It!!!

As my backend capstone, I have decided to create a self help forum for people who stutter!

Stuttering is something that I have dealt with my whole life and over this time I have found things that help my fluency, and wish to pass this on to others.

Since so much of fluency for stutterers is based on confidence while speaking, this site will also feature inspirational quotes from famous people who have stuttered, as well as speech pathologists and other specialists in the field.

Finally, it will have a search engine for meet-ups for stutterers to be able to get together, talk freely with one another about what has worked for them in the past, offer encouragement to one another, and have group practice.
